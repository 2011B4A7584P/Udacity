DATA EXTRACTION FUNDAMENTALS:
----------------------------

This section is about review of the **fundamentals of tabular**
**data (CSV, Excel) and JSON format**


* Data scientists spend about 70% of their time in data wrangling

* **DATA WRANGLING** : *process of gathering (extracting,pulling), cleaning and storing data*

* Only after a proper data wrangling procedure in place, can we perform meaningful analysis on it

* A proper data wrangling procedure therefore ensures that data is in good shape

* Data that has gone through a proper data wrangling procedure and is in good shape and is available for analysis is called prepared data

* We will focus on lots of different types of data namely : music, energy, wikipedia, twitter, etc

* Data formats covered : JSON, HTML, XML, CSV, Excel, legacy text formats

* The last part will focus on how to store data in MongoDB and use it to support analysis

* MongoDB is increasingly important as it is powerful and scalable

* The first step in data wrangling is to assess the source of data on below parameters in order to assess the assumptions about the data :
	* data values present in entire data
	* data types for those data values present in entire data
	* shape of entire data
	* identify errors or outliers in entire data - there are in fact severals ways to check for errors and also for checking whether data is within or outside range of expected values
