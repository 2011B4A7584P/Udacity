NOT operator can be used to perform negation as well NOT IN search from list of possible values. For example :
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT CITY  = 'BERLIN';

HAVING and WHERE clauses cannot be used interchangeably. HAVING is used whenever there is table column along with some aggregate function
in the SELECT clause and HAVING can only be applied to columns and aggregates in present query, it can not use any conditional logic on other columns of the
table being queried if they are not present in the SELECT clause. WHERE is general way of providing table filter conditions.

The difference between the HAVING and WHERE clause in SQL is that the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregates, 
but the HAVING clause can. The WHERE clause works on row's data, not on aggregated data.

use WHERE prior to GROUP BY and HAVING after GROUP BY. 
The WHERE clause acts as a pre filter where as HAVING as a post filter.

A WHERE clause is used to filter records from a result.  The filter occurs before any groupings are made. WHERE cannot be used with aggregates.
A HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group.

When SQL statements have both a WHERE clause and HAVING clause, keep in mind the WHERE clause is applied first, then the results grouped, 
and finally, the groups filtered according to the HAVING clause.

SELECT   SalesOrderID,
         SUM(UnitPrice * OrderQty) AS TotalPrice
FROM     Sales.SalesOrderDetail
GROUP BY SalesOrderID
HAVING   SUM(UnitPrice * OrderQty) > 10000 AND LineTotal > 10

Actually that query generates an error.  The column LineTotal is not part of the group by field list nor the result of an aggregate total.
To be valid the having clause can only compare results of aggregated functions or column part of the group by.

To be valid the query has to be rewritten as
SELECT   SalesOrderID,
         SUM(UnitPrice * OrderQty) AS TotalPrice
FROM     Sales.SalesOrderDetail
WHERE    LineTotal > 100
GROUP BY SalesOrderID
HAVING   SUM(UnitPrice * OrderQty) > 10000

To summarize the difference between WHERE and HAVING:

WHERE is used to filter records before any groupings take place.
HAVING is used to filter values after they have been groups.  Only columns or expressions in the group can be included in the HAVING clause’s conditions…

--Select all records where the second letter of the City is an "a"
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city LIKE '_a%';
