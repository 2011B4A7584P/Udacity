Note that window functions are performed on the result set after all JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses 
and before the ORDER BY, LIMIT and SELECT DISTINCT.

The general syntax of calling a window function is as follows:

window_function_name(expression) OVER ( 
   [partition_defintion]
   [order_definition]
   [frame_definition]
)


The opening and closing parentheses after the OVER clause are mandatory, even with no expression, for example:

window_function_name(expression) OVER()

Note: You can't use window functions and standard aggregations in the same query. More specifically, you can't include window functions in a GROUP BY clause.
