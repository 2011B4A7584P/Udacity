Possible Causes :

1. Latest product features might not have received a positive response from the users - 
   possible causes can be poor user experience, deprecation of available features, possible end of support for particular feature which users were
   predominantly using previously

2. August may be a holiday month for majority of companies, may be holiday month for specific geographical areas.

3. Was August a month of layoffs, may be for a lot of Yammer's corporate clients ?

4. Was there an engagement drop for a users having a particular language preference ?

5. Was there a license expiration for certain user segments ? Quiet a wierd one.

6. Did some of the corporte client intentionally opted for something other than Yammer ? Priority shift.

7. Did anyting similar to Yammer hit the market in Aug or late July ?

find number of monthly active users per month : dropped in Aug month significantly

find number of monthly active users by language : every language category has experienced a drop in user engagement. 
But major focus can be on french, german, indian and korean users as the drop in user engagement wrt to previous month was the most across these languages.

find number of monthly active users by companies : there are lots of companies that did not have a drop in user engagement. We can safely say that
the drop in user engagement behaviour was not an all encompassing outcome as far as company categories are concerned. 

There are companies which specifically even showed growth in user engagement wrt to previous month. We can use this to narrow down our analysis 
on specifically those companies that did experience the drop. In total there are 474 companies that did not experience the drop wrt to previous month.
624 companies did experience the drop.

There 30 companies which have the same numbers wrt to the previous month, looking deeper though, the active user counts are not that huge
for these companies. We can infer that this is merely chance. 

find number of monthly active users by locations : There are 32 locations out of the 47 locations that experienced a drop in user interaction.
These can be specifically looked into on case-by-case basis.

find number of monthly active users by device type used for access : After classifying the device types into mainly 4 types namely - 
desktop, laptop, smartphone and tablet, we deduce that all have experienced a drop in user interaction but smartphone
and tablet cases standout means we need to target those users better.


tutorial.yammer_emails
----------------------
Except sent_reengagement_email action, rest of all the email actions experienced drop in user engagement.
As far as emails received by the users are concerned, only weekly_digest experienced a major drop in engagement. Perhaps this can
be an area of investigation as to what all went in this.
