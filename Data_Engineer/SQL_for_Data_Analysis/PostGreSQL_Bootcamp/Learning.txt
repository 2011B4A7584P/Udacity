LIKE, NOT LIKE are used in pattern matching using wild card characters.

Construct a pattern by combining string with wildcard characters and using LIKE / NOT LIKE operators to find pattern matches :
(Percent)% - for matching any sequence of characters
(Underscore)_ - for matching any single character

One disadvantage of LIKE operator is that it uses the exact match of the pattern and therefore is case-sensitive.

The ILIKE operator is not case-sensitive. Useful when text formatting varies within the column. Used just as the LIKE operator.
