DESIGN PATTERNS:
---------------

+	A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design
+	The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects
+	The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well tested, proven development/design paradigms
+	Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem(s)
+	That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation 
+	By using design patterns, you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable

+	Itâ€™s not mandatory to always implement design patterns in a project 
+	Design patterns are not meant for project development
+	Design patterns are meant for common problem-solving 
+	Whenever there is a need, you have to implement a suitable pattern to avoid such problems in the future. 
	To find out which pattern to use, you just have to try to understand the design patterns and their purposes. 
	Only by doing that, you will be able to pick the right one. 
+	Goal: Understand the purpose and usage of each design pattern in order to pick and implement the correct pattern as needed
